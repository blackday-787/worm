## üí¨ Input ‚Üí Output Flow

### Normal Commands:
```
User says: "move forward"
‚Üí AI translates to: "fl" 
‚Üí Worm does: forward tilt movement
‚Üí Worm says: your "fl" response
```

### Special Commands:
```
User says: "hello there worm"
‚Üí Worm does: choreographed mouth movement
‚Üí Worm says: your "hello_there_worm" response
```

### Custom Categories (Future Implementation):
```
User says: "cheer me up"
‚Üí AI detects: encouragement intent
‚Üí Worm does: encouragement movement + talk sequence
‚Üí Worm says: random response from "encouragement" category
```

## üéØ Smart Mouth Movement

**Short responses (‚â§5 words):**
- Example: "Hello there!" (2 words)
- Gets: **1 mouth movement**

**Long responses (>5 words):**
- Example: "Hello there, thanks for turning me back on!" (8 words)  
- Gets: **2 mouth movements** (spaced during speech)

## ‚úÖ Adding Custom Responses - New Clear Interface!

### Step-by-Step:
1. Run: `python3 edit_worm_responses.py`
2. Choose **5** (Add to existing category)
3. **Select category** from numbered list (1-8)
4. **Enter Speech Output:** What the worm will SAY
5. **Preview** shows word count and mouth movements
6. **Confirm** to save

### Example Session:
```
Select category: 2 (encouragement)
Enter Speech Output: You're doing amazing, keep it up!
Preview: 7 words = 2 mouth movements
Save? y
‚úÖ Added to encouragement!
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Editor Features

- **Clear category explanations** - Know exactly what each does
- **Input vs Output clarity** - No confusion about what gets spoken
- **Word count preview** - See mouth movements before saving
- **Syntax validation** - Prevents common quote errors
- **Category management** - Add to existing or create new categories

## üé¨ Hardware-Optimized Movements

Each movement uses the servo-tendon system effectively:
- **FL/FR/BL/BR servos** create peristaltic (wave-like) body motion
- **MID servo** controls mouth sync with speech
- **Movements embody emotional tone** of each category
- **Medium-sized sequences** that flow naturally with speech

## ‚úÖ Correct Syntax Examples

```json
"startup": "Hello there, I'm your worm friend!"
"fl": "Moving forward with excitement!"
"d": "Let's dance!"
```

## ‚ùå Common Syntax Errors

```json
‚ùå "startup": Hello there     (missing quotes)
‚ùå "fl": "Let's "dance""      (nested quotes)
‚ùå "d": "Let's dance!,        (missing closing quote)
```
